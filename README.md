# Holberton Backend Python Projects

This repository contains various Python projects focused on different aspects of backend development and programming concepts.

## Projects Overview

### 0x00 - Python Variable Annotations
This project demonstrates the use of Python variable annotations to indicate the type of variables, functions, and return types. It includes examples such as type checking and defining variable types explicitly.

**Files in this directory:**
- `0-add.py`: Simple function to add two numbers.
- `1-concat.py`: Function to concatenate two strings.
- `2-floor.py`: Returns the floor of a number.
- `3-to_str.py`: Converts a number to a string.
- `4-define_variables.py`: Demonstrates variable definitions with annotations.
- `5-sum_list.py`: Function to sum a list of numbers.
- `6-sum_mixed_list.py`: Sums mixed lists of integers and floats.
- `7-to_kv.py`: Returns key-value pairs of a dictionary.
- `8-make_multiplier.py`: Function that multiplies a number by a constant.
- `9-element_length.py`: Returns the length of a list element.
- `100-safe_first_element.py`: Safely gets the first element from a list.
- `101-safely_get_value.py`: Retrieves a value safely from a dictionary.
- `102-type_checking.py`: Checks the type of a given input.

### 0x01 - Python Async Function
This project explores asynchronous programming in Python. It introduces asynchronous functions, coroutines, and tasks, highlighting how Python handles concurrency and allows non-blocking operations.

**Files in this directory:**
- `0-basic_async_syntax.py`: Introduction to async syntax.
- `1-concurrent_coroutines.py`: Running multiple coroutines concurrently.
- `2-measure_runtime.py`: Measures the runtime of an asynchronous function.
- `3-tasks.py`: Working with tasks in asynchronous programming.
- `4-tasks.py`: Further exploration of tasks with async functions.

### 0x02 - Python Async Comprehension
This project demonstrates asynchronous comprehensions, an advanced feature in Python that allows for asynchronous iteration over collections. It focuses on async generators and comprehension with async/await.

**Files in this directory:**
- `0-async_generator.py`: Introduction to asynchronous generators.
- `1-async_comprehension.py`: Using asynchronous comprehensions.
- `2-measure_runtime.py`: Measures runtime with async comprehension.

### 0x03 - Unittests and Integration Tests
In this project, you will explore the concepts of unit testing and integration testing in Python. It demonstrates how to write tests to ensure that individual components or the whole system behave as expected.

**Files in this directory:**
- `client.py`: Contains code for a basic client.
- `fixtures.py`: Test fixtures for setting up and cleaning up test data.
- `test_client.py`: Unit tests for the client functionality.
- `test_utils.py`: Unit tests for utility functions.
- `utils.py`: Contains utility functions used in the project.
- `README.md`: Overview and details for unit testing concepts.

## Setup

To get started with any of the projects:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/holbertonschool-backend-python.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the desired project folder:
    ```bash
    cd 0x00-python_variable_annotations  # Or any other directory
    ```

3. Install dependencies (if any) using:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Each project contains Python scripts designed to solve specific problems or demonstrate programming concepts. Run them by executing the corresponding Python file, e.g.,

```bash
cd 0x00-python_variable_annotations
python 0-add.py
```
